<p><strong>The LRS Test evaluates whether an LRS meets the technical requirements of the xAPI specification.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A successful LRS Test means that:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the LRS successfully completed the tests run by a specific version of the LRS Test Suite<br>
there is reasonable certainty that the LRS correctly implements the LRS requirements in the xAPI specification</li>
<li>there is reasonable certainty that the LRS will behave as expected when handling xAPI requests from learning record producers (LRP) and learning record consumers (LRC)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This does not mean that:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the LRS is endorsed by the ADL Initiative, DoD, or Federal Government</li>
<li>the LRS is guaranteed to have been tested for defects in all functionality</li>
<li>the LRS has been evaluated against or is otherwise certified to meet cybersecurity requirements</li>
